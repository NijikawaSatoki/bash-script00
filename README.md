# bash-script00
Some simple bash scripts that anybody using a bash CLI can certainly use.

IF YOU ARE ON LINUX, OSX, MSYS2, OR CYGWIN:
These shell scripts can be placed in $HOME and executed via
$ bash [scriptname].sh

IF YOU ARE ON WINDOWS:
Then... I'm deeply sorry. You'd have to use MSYS2 or Cygwin to run these scripts.
